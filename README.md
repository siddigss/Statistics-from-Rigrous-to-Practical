# Statistics-from-Rigrous-to-Practical

Check the note book called `Statistics from Rigorous to Practical.ipynb` above.  
There is a pdf and an html version.

### Notes
* It is assumed the reader has basic knowledge in measure theory.
* It is assumed the reader has basic knowledge in statistics.
* Simulations are writte in python, but one can skip them.

### Goal
In mathematics definitions are usually written clearly, this does not mean how their usage or connections to applications is clear at all. Mathematics students usually in measure theory course take an abstract introductions (as it should be) to probability. Then (or even before) in statistics introductory course they do not make use of such notions nor are the notions or assumptions in these courses defined crystal clearly. In fact one even see that in practice the assumptions sometimes are followed loosely. Surely one can apply what he studied there but one would like to ask for more. The goal of this write up is clarify the connection between the two for anyone who is confused or wondering.

### Status
* Quick of some notions from measure theory tools.
* Hypothesis Testing Notions and Examples. **Working on it**

### Version: 1.2
